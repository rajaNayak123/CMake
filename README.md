# What is CMake üßê
  CMake is a tool that helps manage the build process of software projects. 
  It‚Äôs used with C and C++ programs to generate the necessary files to compile and link a program on different platforms. 
  CMake simplifies creating makefiles (for Linux) or project files (for Visual Studio on Windows) by writing a simple configuration file instead of creating them manually for each platform.
  ## Why Use CMake?
  - Cross-platform: It can generate build files for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
  - Easier management: Instead of writing specific makefiles for each environment, you only need to write one CMake configuration file.
